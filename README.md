# Pokémon, gotta code 'em all!
Want to know what type of Pokémon Gengar is? Well try out my very own Pokédex!</br> 
If you're reading this and you're not very familiar with Pokémon, then you're probably wondering to yourself: "What in the actual pancakes do any of the words mean that I just read?" </br>

I'll try to explain it to you as short and sweet as possible. Pokémon is a very popular game and anime, where the objective is to catch these mystical creatures known as Pokémon. </br> 
Each and every single Pokémon is unique, some breathe fire, some live at the bottom of the sea, and some are even capable of commiting tax fraud (looking at you Meowth, the IRS is on to you). </br>

Once the player has captured a Pokémon, they can see all possible information regarding that species of Pokémon on a neat little device called the Pokédex. So a Pokédex is basically an encyclopedia for Pokémon. </br>

If this is all still a bit confusing, then try out my Pokédex and play with it for a while. Sometimes things just make **way** more sense if you see it in action for yourself, instead of just reading some words. </br>

There are more fun stuff to discover about the world of Pokémon, but this is basically everything that you need to know for this project.

## Episode 1 : I Choose You!
As someone who is **extremely** familiar with Pokémon, I'm most certain that I will enjoy this assignment very much. The biggest challenge will definitely be working with an API. </br>

I don't have a lot of experience with API's, but I'm excited to learn how to use them. </br>

I will start out by creating all necessary files, and then playing around with the API for a bit. I want to figure out how to access certain data from it and show it on the website. In order to really understand how something works, I need to take my sweet time with something and check out all the fun possibilities it presents. </br>

Only when that task has been done, will I try and figure out my next move

## Fun Features
- [ ] Show typing of Pokémon
- [ ] Show the abilities of Pokémon
- [ ] Add Pokemon #591 in my Pokédex
- [ ] Add a "Previously Searched button", so that the user can go back to the previously viewed Pokémon
  * I think I'll do this by adding an array that will be used to store the date of the Pokémon once the user has clicked on the button that will show them the Pokémon they searched for.
- [ ] Adding a "next" and "previous" button, so the user can just scroll through the Pokédex even when they're a little unfamiliar with Pokémon.
